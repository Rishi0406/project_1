### Motivation and Aim
The motivation for this project is two-fold - 
1. To examine trends in game releases in the past 5 years
2. To find out what factors make certain games more highly rated

**Specific questions** include - 
* Do number of games released differ across the past 5 years? 
  * This will give us an indication of whether the gaming industry is growing over time.
* Do number of games released differ across the months?
  * This will give us an indication of whether game releases follow a seasonal variation.
* Do game ratings differ by the month of release?
* Do game ratings differ by the platform on which it runs?
* Do game ratings differ by their genre?

### Dataset
1. Game release and rating data from the [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://api.rawg.io/docs/)
